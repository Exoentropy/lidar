In stats.h:
-changed the (*(points+i)) to points[i] as per coding guidelines

In terrace.cpp:
-changed the error message to reflect terrace instead of fixlidar
-changed the (*(points+i)) to points[i] as per coding guidelines
-fixed the memory leak in the second else if statement, where points[i] was deleted after the new point was stored.
-omitted repeated code in the if statements
-deleted the array when finished
-stored the address, rather than constant calls of z() method
-added const where appropriate
-added comments
-avoids removing any elements by changing the z of the current rather than creating a new point

Would change (if allowed in assignment):
-in the Point class, add a get and set method, rather than dealing with addresses
-either use a list or way to calculate the number of points, rather using a raw integer in the code
