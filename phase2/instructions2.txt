Instructions for assignment 2

0. [1 pt] Put your name in name.txt

1. [19 pts] Write a program called "quartile."  Put your code in quartile.cpp.
   This program reads integer scores from stdin and prints out the sorted 
   scores in each quartile.  It then prints out statistics on each quartile,
   including min, max, spread (max-min), and average.  The average should be
   rounded to the nearest integer.  For example, if you run:
  
        cat quartile.dat | ./quartile
  
   the output will be:

The sorted scores in each quartile are:
  q1  q2  q3  q4
  32  77  83  89
  46  79  83  90
  48  79  83  90
  55  79  84  92
  57  79  84  94
  66  80  84  94
  67  80  84  94
  69  81  84  95
  70  81  88  97
  72  81  89  98
  76  82  89  99

Statistics for each quartile are:
     min max spr avg
q1    32  76  44  60
q2    77  82   5  80
q3    83  89   6  85
q4    89  99  10  94
  
   You can assume that the number of scores is evenly divisible by 4.

   Remember, getting the program correct is only the first step.  You will
   be graded on clarity, brevity, style, comments and efficiency.  This
   program must have at least one function besides main(), but I expect
   that you will want to have more than that.
  
   HINTS:
  
   See section 3.1.1 for suggestions on how to read in values until EOF is
   reached.  See the second-to-last paragraph on page 36 to see to to send
   EOF to stdin if entering values in a the command-line.
  
   The header of the first output table can be printed with this statement:
      cout << setw(4) << "q1" 
           << setw(4) << "q2" 
           << setw(4) << "q3" 
           << setw(4) << "q4" << endl;
   You'll have to include<iomanip> to use setw().
  
   If you choose to have a vector of vectors you should use the form
        vector<vector<int> >
   If you have the last two greater than signs right next to each other you will
   get a compiler error. 

2. Check your code against the applicable coding guidelines at 
   cs.utexas.edu/~edwardsj/teaching/2011spring/cs105/coding_guidelines.html

3. Submit all files using turnin.  This can be done as follows:
        turnin --submit edwardsj assignment2 *
